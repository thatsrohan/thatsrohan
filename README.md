# 💫 About Me:
I’m a hybrid ML–Data–Systems engineer focused on building production-oriented, performance-conscious systems.<br><br>I’ve built a multimodal AI-powered music recommendation engine integrating ALS matrix factorization, TF-IDF similarity modeling, and emotion-aware computer vision inference. I engineered a latency profiling framework with percentile-based (P50/P90/P99) tail-latency analysis to evaluate real-time ML pipelines under realistic constraints.<br><br>On the systems side, I’ve developed distributed services using gRPC, RESTful backend architectures with Laravel, and a multiplayer game server skeleton with structured session management. I actively explore spatial optimization techniques such as Binary Space Partitioning (BSP) within game and real-time system contexts.<br><br>My work also includes healthcare analytics automation systems, synthetic dataset engineering, interactive KPI dashboards, and embedded firmware development for an ESP32-based quadcopter with real-time sensor integration.<br><br>I’m currently deepening my expertise in system design, scalable backend architecture, and interview-grade data structures & algorithms.<br><br>I care about clean boundaries, measurable performance, and building systems that behave well under real-world constraints — not just in controlled demos.
